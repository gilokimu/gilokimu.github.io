##Day 0
Spent time researching on about the service industry
Had to decide on whether home services or all services
Temporarily decided on all services

##Day 1
Spec - ing out backend services
	- Firebase proved out to be terrible as a backend
- Contentful too expensive
- Parse was good enough
    - However its been discontinued by fb

Purchased a digital ocean to install Parse, proved to be tricky after getting stuck installing mongo db
Resorted to temporarily subscribe to shashido - might make it permanent due to autoscaling

Also decided Parse will be the far, I will go with a backend and all other functions will happen on mobile, including admin functions
